      1. Overview of the NFT Marketplace
    </p>
    <p>
      The NFT Marketplace provides you with the opportunity to create (or as we call it, mint),
      sell,purchase, bid on, collect, trade, showcase and otherwise transact digital blockchain
      collectibles, which may be represented as a non-fungible token (“NFT”) linked with certain
      digital media and art (“NFT Media”).
    </p>
    <p>
      We facilitate transactions between buyer and seller of an NFT, but we are not a party to any
      agreement between buyer and seller of an NFT on the NFT Marketplace. We collect revenue on the
      NFT Marketplace via transaction fees and other applicable fees which we display when you
      interact with the NFT Marketplace. For the avoidance of doubt, NFTs transacted on the NFT
      Marketplace are considered “Digital Assets” as defined in the Naffiti Terms. Company reserves
      the right to be the final decision maker on any disputes arising from purchases via the NFT
      Marketplace, including in connection with any auctions or other purchase methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      For NFT Sellers: By minting, providing, or selling an NFT through the NFT Marketplace, you
      hereby represent and warrant that you own all legal right, title and interest in all
      intellectual property rights to the NFT Media linked or associated with such NFT, or you are
      legally authorized by the intellectual property owner to mint, provide or sell the NFT on the
      NFT Marketplace. Except for NFTs minted on the NFT Marketplace, in order to list any NFT for
      sale on the NFT Marketplace, you must first deposit the NFT for sale for custody with Company
      until such time as the NFT is sold or you decide to remove the NFT from the NFT Marketplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      For clarity, Company has no obligation or liability to you for keeping, storing, or helping
      you recover any NFT Media associated with your NFTs. For NFT Buyers: When you purchase an NFT,
      you own the NFT that is associated with certain NFT Media, but you do not own any intellectual
      property rights in such NFT Media except for the license grants expressly set forth herein.
      In certain cases, we may help to evaluate or provide you with information about a seller of an
      NFT.However, such information is provided for informational purposes only. You bear full
      responsibility for verifying the authenticity, legitimacy, identity of any NFT you purchase on
      the NFT Marketplace. We make no guarantees or promises about the identity, legitimacy, or
      authenticity of any NFT on the NFT Marketplace.
